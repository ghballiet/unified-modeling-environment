1. Generic processes should specify the number and type of arguments
   (even when there is only one generic entity type).

   NOTE: This means that generic processes may include multiple
   arguments of the same generic entity type.

2. Arguments to concrete processes should NOT specify types or
   pattern-match variables; they should take concrete entities as
   arguments, or at least they CAN take them as arguments.

   NOTE: For the agent-based models, we may need to include pattern
   match variables in arguments of concrete equations, but it is not
   necessary for algebraic models.

3. The system should let users provide a file with observed values for
   exogenous variables and plot model-predicted "trajectories" over
   "time" for specified variables; it should also plot the observed
   values for requested endogenous variables.

   NOTE: There will actually be two files: one for exogenous
   variables, and one for endogenous variables. The file containing
   values for endogenous variables represents empirical observations
   or facts, which should be plotted alongside the values computed
   from the simulation. This will allow students to compare the
   results of simulating their model to the results in the file. These
   files will be space- and newline-delimited.

4. Users should be able to edit names or values without deleting the
   entry and recreating it with another spelling.

5. The user should not have to check a box to indicate that an
   equation is algebraic; a drop-down menu would make more sense.

6. Users should be able to resize the frames for generic and concrete
   elements and the graphs for simulation results; also, the system
   should not run text over the edge of frames.

7. When the user creates an equation, the system should ensure that
   all attributes in the equation have already been declared.
