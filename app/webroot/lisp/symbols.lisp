;; Symbol-manipulation utilities.

;; MVL variables are of two types: normal variables, which begin with
;; the character "?" followed by any character other than a "*", and
;; sequence variables, which begin with "?*".

;; Variables are created using gentemp.  The functions that do that are
;; new-?var and new-*var.

;; Functions for creating and sensing variables.  The sensing functions
;; include checks to make sure that the argument is not simply the
;; one-character string "?" by making sure that it is at least two
;; characters long.

;; To check to see if something is a variable, just check to see if the
;; first character is a "?".  To check the type, you have to be careful
;; to make sure you don't look at the second character of a symbol with
;; a 1-character name.

;; the user can figure out what's going on).  Of course, when these
;; variables are actually displayed, they will frequently appear as
;; #:?var since they are uninterned.
